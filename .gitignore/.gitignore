￼ +This is a DOM-based game of Snake that I wrote in JavaScript a few years back.
￼ +
￼ +Other than the full screen mode demonstrated in the code, it can also be 
￼ +initialized in div tags within a page. Example:
￼ +
￼ +    var mySnakeBoard = new SNAKE.Board( {
￼ +                                            boardContainer: "game-area",
￼ +                                            fullScreen: true,
￼ +                                            width: 580,
￼ +                                            height:1000
￼ +                                        });
￼ +                                    
￼ +The comments are formatted a little strange because at the time I was playing
￼ +around with YUI Doc.
